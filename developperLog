day 1: install vscode setup bone structure of code (what classes and basic files are made up of it) and took time separately to read the details of the coursework
        -this was done separately as we intended to come together with each an explanation of this and come to an agreement of how it is structure
        -doing this separately allowed us to correct the details the other misunderstood and come to a common consensus of what should be done

        setup of junit for vscode alone, as it needs only to be done on one computer (Leo)
